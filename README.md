# AnalyticRayTracing
C++ code for analytic ray tracing

## Prerequisites
You will need to have a functioning installation of [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) ([1.16](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/gsl-1.16.tar.gz) is verified to work).
- You will need to set the enviromnent variable `${GSLDIR}` to your local installation of GSL.
- You will also need to have `${GSLDIR}` in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

## Getting Going
Getting going is easy. Just:
- Make it: `make analytic_raytracing`
- Run it: `./analytic_raytracing`
- The main is at the bottom of the code, which you can modify to your liking.
  - You can find if, and how many, solutions exist to the ray tracing problem.
  - Find the ray tracing path, path length, time of flight, and attenuation factor of the ray.
  - Find the launch and receive angles for the ray.

## Performance
- On a 3.40 GHz Intel i7-3770 machine, locating if, and how many, ray tracing solutions exists typically takes ~0.5 ms.

## Benchmarking and Valiation
- The `test` folder contains two subfolders `benchmarking` and `validation`
- The `validation` folder contains function-by-function comparison to the origianl python version by Christian Glaser
- The `benchmarking` folder contains a comparison between the C++ implementation and the python implementation by Christian Glaser

## Credit
- This is largely a C++ transcription of the **fantastic** work done by Christian Glaser for the InIceSim working group.
- Python version can be found [here](https://github.com/cg-laser/NuRadioMC).
